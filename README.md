### Resume Data Structure

The portfolio is customized through the `resume.json` file located in the `src` directory. Here's how to modify each section:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "statement": "Your Role/Title",
  "about": "A brief description about yourself",
  "tech": {
    "languages": ["Language1", "Language2"],
    "frameworks": ["Framework1", "Framework2"],
    "tools": ["Tool1", "Tool2"],
    "databases": ["Database1", "Database2"]
  }
}
```

### ASCII Art Name

To customize the ASCII art display of your name:

1. Create your ASCII art using an online generator or tool
2. Go to `pagehero.tsx` in the project and add it
